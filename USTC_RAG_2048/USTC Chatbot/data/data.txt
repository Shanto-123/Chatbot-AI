Vice Chancellor Message:
“It brings me immense pleasure to extend a warm welcome to all students and visitors of the University of Science & Technology Chittagong (USTC). As the Vice Chancellor of this esteemed institution, I am honored to address you and share the remarkable journey that has shaped USTC into the beacon of learning and innovation that it is today.

Our history is one of dedication, vision, and progress. USTC emerged as a testament to the transformative power of education, with its foundation laid through the sponsorship of a private charity on that pivotal day of May 13, 1989. This act of benevolence demonstrated a deep commitment to advancing education and creating a platform where knowledge could flourish. Since then, USTC has continued to uphold this commitment and has evolved into a dynamic institution that contributes significantly to the educational landscape of Bangladesh.

The turning point in USTC’s history came with its elevation to a full-fledged university status following the promulgation of the Private University Act in 1992. This transformative moment allowed us to expand our horizons and offer a diverse array of academic programs. This transformation was not just a legal formality; it marked the beginning of a new era for USTC, one in which we could provide comprehensive education that transcends boundaries and disciplines.

At USTC, academic excellence is ingrained in our core values. We take immense pride in the dedication and caliber of our faculty members and staff, who work tirelessly to provide a nurturing environment for our students. Our commitment to academic rigor is exemplified by our faculties, each of which plays a crucial role in shaping our students’ journeys.

The Faculty Of Science, Engineering & Technology (FSET) is a hub of innovation and inquiry, fostering the next generation of engineers, scientists, and technologists. The Faculty of Basic Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, alongside the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, stands as a testament to our dedication to health sciences and research, driving advancements in medical knowledge and pharmaceutical discoveries.

Our commitment to holistic education is further reflected in the Faculty of Business Administration, which equips students with the skills and insights required to thrive in the dynamic world of commerce. The Faculty of Social Science and Humanities reminds us of the significance of understanding the human experience, society, and culture, fostering critical thinking and empathy in our students.

As you embark on your journey at USTC, I encourage you to seize the opportunities that abound within our campus. Engage with your peers, collaborate with faculty members, and immerse yourselves in the vibrant academic and extracurricular activities that USTC offers. Our state-of-the-art facilities, research centers, and well-equipped libraries are here to facilitate your quest for knowledge.

USTC’s journey from its inception through its transformation to the present day has been marked by resilience, growth, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. Together, as a united community, we shall continue to shape the future of education, research, and innovation. I am confident that your time at USTC will be transformative and inspiring, and I eagerly anticipate the remarkable contributions you will make to our society and the world. Thank you for being a part of the USTC family.”

Background
University of Science and Technology Chittagong (USTC) was established as a Private University soon after Private University Act 1992 came into force when IAHS became its constituent body under Faculty of Medicine. The Janasheba Foundation has been its sponsoring organization and National Professor Dr. Nurul Islam was appointed the Vice Chancellor of USTC by Honourable Chancellor of the Universities and President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh (PRB). Since then USTC started functioning with two Faculties, namely, Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Basic Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences. MBBS and BPharm (Hons) Programmes are offered by these two Faculties. These two Faculties have been doing more than expectation and it is a matter of pride that Faculty of Medicine has a large number of foreign students today. Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology has opened up a new horizon for the Technological community of the country by launching a new Faculty entitled Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology (FSET)' in 1999 which is indeed another bold step by USTC in fulfilling its mission of expansion of higher education through private initiative. FSET had been started with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering since 1999 and now, this faculty constitutes with three (03) departments named as Computer Science & Engineering (CSE), Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering (ETE).

Abstract: This study compared knowledge and prevalence of high-blood-pressure (HBP) among teaching and non-teaching-staff of University of Lagos, Nigeria. Multi-stage-sampling-technique was used to select 978 respondents in 9 Faculties and Senate building. An adapted pre-tested WHO-STEPwise questionnaire was used to collect data on respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics, HBP-knowledge, risk-factors and complications. Blood-pressure was measured and mean-knowledge-scores for HBP general-information, risk-factors, complications and overall-knowledge computed. Data was analysed at p<0.05.Teaching and non-teaching-staff ages were 48.9±8.56 vs. 41.8±9.40 years. Teaching-staff had higher mean-knowledge-scores on HBP general-knowledge (4.3 vs. 3.5 %); risk factors (12.4 vs.11.2 %); overall-knowledge (23.2 vs. 21.0 %) than non-teaching-staff but equal for HBP complication mean-knowledge-scores (5.7 vs. 5.5 %). Mean Systolic-blood-pressure was teaching (127.05±13.44) & non-teaching-staff (123.64±16.15 mmHg); Diastolic-blood-pressure: teaching (79.62±7.68) & non-teaching-staff (78.56±9.57mmHg). HBP-prevalence was higher among teaching (24.2 %) than non-teaching-staff (22.9 %). Knowledge of HBP risk-factors and overall-knowledge were statistically significantly associated with HBP in both groups. Odds of HBP among teaching-staff decreased with good-knowledge of HBP risk-factors (OR = 0.57; 95% CI: (0.35-0.92); p=0.021)). Poor knowledge of HBP was higher among non-teaching-staff than teaching-staff

A comparative assessment of knowledge and prevalence of high blood pressure among teaching and non-teaching staff of University of Lagos, Nigeria 
Introduction High blood pressure is a silent killer and a global public health problem (WHO, 2013). Adult high blood pressure (HBP) affects 1.13 billion people (597 million men, 20 % and 529 million women, 24 %) (WHO, 2017; DIPR, 2017). Studies have shown that HBP is currently more prevalent in developing countries (40 %) than in their developed countries counterparts (35 %) (WHO, 2010). This prevalence is highest in Africa (46.0 %) (WHO, 2013).Recent cross-sectional studies have reported high prevalence of HBP among employees of Universities in a Saudi Arabian University, teaching staff or faculty members (32.0 %) and non-teaching or administrative staff (0 %) (Amin et al., 2014) and faculty members (39.2 %) of a Health sciences college at Saudi Arabia (Mohammad and Abdullah, 2017).High blood pressure is also a public health problem in Nigeria (Nigerian Hypertension Society, 1996; Murphy et al., 2013). Among Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria blood pressure patterns indicated a high blood pressure among teaching (20.1 %) and non-teaching (14.8 %) (Adedoyin et al., 2016); a hypertension prevalence o 21.8 % among the staff of University of Ibadan(Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011); (21.33 %) among medical lecturers in Port Harcourt which is lower that of the working adult population in Nigeria 41 % (25 % in females and 16 % in males) (Oyeyemi and Adeyemi, 2013). According to the 7th report of the Joint National Committee (JNC) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of high blood pressure (JNC 7) published in 2003, the cut-off point for HBP was ≥140/90 mmHg but a new guideline titled 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults released in late November, 2017 updated the JNC7 cut-off point for HBP as ≥130/80 mmHg (Reboussin et al., 2017). The success of any disease prevention programme depends on community knowledge and practices of risk factors, management and prevention (Mbuya et al., 2014). Good knowledge of hypertension has been found to be independently associated with increased control of hypertension (Maginga et al., 2016). Most of the studies on general knowledge of high blood pressure were cross-sectional studies. A study among members of teaching staff of higher institutions in Dar es Salami, Tanzania reported that 65.5 % agreed that hypertension can be prevented, 73.4 % respondents correctly identified causes of hypertension as stress and hereditary (43.2 %) (Mbuya et al., 2014). Another study on knowledge of hypertension among the staff of University of Ibadan revealed that the knowledge of risk factors of hypertension was still loweven though knowledge about HBP complications was considerably high (Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011) Sub-optimal knowledge of HBP was found among the staff of University of Ibadan and also among non-academic employees of Niger Delta University (Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011; Adika et al., 2011).Among the respondents from Niger Delta University,65.0 % did not know that management of hypertension is

life-long, 30.0 % did not know that hypertension cannot be cured once diagnosed and 80.0 % did not know that weight loss strategies were very crucial in controlling hypertension even though higher percentage had adequate knowledge of blood pressure measurement (80.0 %) and blood pressure monitoring (75.0 %); 73.0 % of the employees thought that the cause of hypertension was thinking, worries and stress, hereditary (59.0 %), high fat diet (80.0 %), smoking (45.0 %), alcohol (43.0 %) and high salt diet (72.0 %) (Adika et al., 2011). Among the teaching staff of higher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the knowledge of risk factors of HBP was reported as follows: alcoholism (54.7 %), smoking (38.1 %), high salt diet (50.4 %), increasing age (36.7 %), obesity (60.4 %) and family history of hypertension (41.7 %) (Mbuya et al., 2014). The study also reported the knowledge of complications of HBP as follows: kidney failure (30.2 %), loss of vision (65.5 %) and heart failure and stroke (71.2 %). The study concluded that there is a low knowledge of causes, signs and symptoms, risk factors and complications of hypertension among the respondents. Causes of HBP in this study were also listed as stress (73.4 %), hereditary (43.2 %) and certain drugs (17.3 %) (Mbuya et al., 2014). Teaching profession has been associated with many stresses both nationally and internationally (McIntyre, 2012). Government policies are encouraging mass literacy in Nigeria and so many university programs are springing up to accommodate the teeming youths. These programs include BSc; MSc (full-time and part-time), sandwich, weekend, distance learning continuing education, lifelong and continuing education and foundation programs and university lecturers champion them including the numerous administrative duties also assigned to them. It has been suggested that differences in job prescription and responsibilities might contribute to the variation in disease exposure and high blood pressure (Adedoyin, et al. 2016). There is a need to assess the knowledge and prevalence of high blood pressure among the staff of University of Lagos as a preventive measure towards this “silent killer” disease. No comparative study has been done on prevalence of HBP and its knowledge among teaching and non-teaching staff of any Nigerian University. The aim of this study therefore is to carry out a comparative analysis to assess and compare the knowledge and prevalence of high blood pressure among the teaching and non-teaching staff of University of Lagos, Nigeria. Materials and Methods Study Design This study was a descriptive, cross-sectional comparative study aimed at assessing and comparing knowledge of risk factors and prevalence of high blood pressure among teaching and non- teaching staff in University of Lagos. Study population The study population was both teaching and non-teaching adult staff of the university,

aged 18 years and above similar to Khalili et al. (2002); Geaney et al., (2015) and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), (2017). Inclusion criteria The staff of the University who were eligible to participate in the study were apparent- ly healthy individuals free of obvious disabilities, full-time workers of the university and were ≥ 18 years old. Exclusion criteria Excluded from the study were causal workers, pregnant women, staff of UNILAG Medical Centre, Akoka and Four Faculties (Faculty of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences). Determination of Sample Size The sample size formula for comparison of independent sample populations was used (Anzhela, 2013). This calculation considering the standard normal deviation at 95 % confidence (α probability) interval set at 1.96, the power of the study 1.28, prevalence of high blood pressure among teaching staff (39.2 %) (Amin et al., 2014), non-teaching staff (50.0%) (Alzeidan et al., 2016) and 10 % non-response gave a sample size of 489. 
where 
n = 
[(p1q1 + p2q2)] * (Zα (p2 – p1)2 + Zβ)2 n = Minimum sample size required for each group. p = Prevalence of high blood pressure q = Complimentary prevalence of high blood pressure Zα = The standard normal deviation at 95 % confidence (α probability) interval set at 1.96. Zβ = The power of the study. Sampling method A multistage sampling technique was used to select teaching and non-teaching staff in their various faculties and Senate building. A list of faculties, departments, service units and staff strength of teaching and non-teaching staff was collected from the Registrar’s Office. Staff was stratified into the twelve faculties. Purposive sampling technique was then used to select nine out of the twelve faculties for both the teaching and non-teaching staff. Proportionate random sampling technique (PPS) was used to determine the number of teaching staff and non-teaching selected from each faculty to ensure a representative sample. There were nine faculties plus the administrative units in Senate building. Faculties were stratified according to departments using stratified sampling technique. PPS was calculated as: teaching staff strength per department divided by faculty staff strength multiplied by the number of participants to be selected per faculty. Systematic random sampling was used to select the teaching staff from the departmental lists to make up the 489-sample size. Office visitation was carried out. If the staff was not willing to participate, the next staff was visited until the departmental

sample size was met. This procedure was carried out for all the departments. About 4.0 – 5.0 % of teaching staff refused to participate. Data collection Six research assistants were trained and used to collect the data with the researcher. Data was collected using an adapted version of the World Health Organisation (WHO)-STEP-wise surveillance questionnaire for non-communicable disease risk factors (STEPS) instrument V3.1 consisting of two steps: Step 1: questionnaire for behavioural measurements and Step 2: physical measurements (WHO, 2018). The WHO STEPS is a validated and standardized instrument that can be adapted in any relevant study. A adapted questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of high blood pressure definition, diagnosis, signs and symptoms, risk factors and complications as done byOlack et al., (2015) and Vaidya et al., (2013). The questionnaire was divided into eight sections (A – E) with a total of 48 questions A: socio-demographic data (9 questions); B: knowledge of high blood pressure (12 questions); C: knowledge of risk factors associated with high blood pressure (19 ques- tions); D: knowledge of health risks (complications) of high blood pressure (8 ques- tions) and E: blood pressure measurement. The questionnaire was pretested and revised before final usage by administering it to the participants. The drafted questionnaire was subjected to face validity, content validity to ensure that the questions covered the objectives and construct validity to make sure that the objectives of the study were actually measured. To achieve the consistency of the questionnaire, the questions were translated to a local language (Yoruba) for better understanding and then back translated. The reliability test of questions gave the cronbach’s alpha values for the sections as follows: 0.602 for entire knowledge scale, 0.617 for Section B (general knowledge of high blood pressure); 0.861 for Section C (knowledge of risk factors) and 0.731 for section D (knowledge of complications). Assessment of blood pressure Blood pressure of respondents was measured using an automatic blood pressure monitor, sphygmomanometer (Omron IntelliSense M2 Basic, Japan). A day before the day of measurement, the researcher visited the faculties, through the office of the Dean, participants were advised to avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 minutes prior to measurement (National Institute of Health (NIH, 2004)). Before the measurement, the participants were identified by asking them if they took coffee, smoked or exercised that morning. Anyone that answered ‘yes’ was disqualified. Those that just finished eating, were asked to wait for at least 30 minutes before the measurement was taken. The participants were allowed to sit down quietly and rest on a chair for five minutes (National Institute of Health, 2004). The blood pressure was 
06 
A comparative assessment of knowledge and prevalence of high blood pressure among teaching and non-teaching staff of University of Lagos, Nigeria 
measured in sitting position with the feet flat on the floor and the arm placed on the table so that the arm is at the same level as the heart. The participants were instructed to remain calm and not to speak during the measurement while the palm was turned upward. Then the blood pressure was measured on the left upper arm resting on the table with an appropriately sized cuff encircling at least 80 percent of the arm (Eng et al., 2016). The instruments automatically displayed the systolic and diastolic blood pressures and then the pulse. Two independent blood pressure (BP) readings were taken at five minutes intervals (Awoke et al., 2012; NIH, 2004). Mean of the two readings were taken to determine the blood pressure status of the participants. High blood pressure was defined as systolic and diastolic BP of ≥ 140 or ≥ 90 mmHg respectively (NIH, 2004). Blood pressure was classified according to 7th Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of HBP (JNC 7)for adults 18 years and above (NIH, 2004). The blood pressure was also classified according to the 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults for 18 years and above released in late November, 2017 to test its impact on the prevalence of HBP. High blood pressure was defined as systolic and diastolic BP of ≥ 130 or ≥ 80 mmHg respectively (Whelton et al. 2017).Participants that had BP in the hypertensive range were given diet and lifestyle treatment advice and referred to the University Medical Centre for further diagnosis and treatment. Operational definition High blood pressure (HBP): high blood pressure was defined in two ways as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and diastolic pressure ≥90 mmHg (JNC7) and ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg according to JNC 8, 2017 (Whelton et al., 2017) similar to Opara et al., (2014); Amin et al., (2014) and Olack et al., (2015). HBP was then grouped into two: hypertensive and not-hypertensive. Data analysis Data was collated, cleaned and entered into Excel sheet. From Excel, it was imported into SPSS for analysis. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Descriptive statistics was used to describe and summary the pattern of all the data and result was presented as frequencies, mean and standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables were expressed as proportions and percentages while continuous variables were expressed as means and standard deviations (± SD) using Independent samples T-test. Mean knowledge scores for HBP general information, risk factors, complica- tions and overall knowledge were computed. Data was analysed and compared using descriptive statistics, chi-square, student t-test and binary logistic regression to assess the predictors of HBP at p<0.05.

Data scoring Scoring of knowledge of HBP items The knowledge questions had three responses and were scored as follows: “yes” = 1, “no” = 0 and “I don’t know” = 0. Every correct answer was scored 1 and wrong answer or don’t know response got 0 point. This scoring was separately done for knowledge on general HBP information, knowledge on risk factors and knowledge on complications of HBP. Knowledge was scored from 0 to 10 (for general knowledge), 0-19 (risk factors) and 0-8 (for complications). The scores were summed up and converted to percentages by dividing the individual scores by the total and multiplying by 100. Higher scores reflected good knowledge. Participants were categorized as having poor (<40 %), fair (40-59 %) and good (60-100 %) levels of knowledge similar to the scoring system of Mbuya et al., (2014) and Dada et al., (2016). Knowledge of HBP was coded as: For general knowledge: <4 was coded as 0, 4-5 was coded as 1 and ≥6 was coded as 2. For risk factors: <8 was coded as 0, 8-11 was coded as 1 and ≥12 as 2 and overall knowledge as: <15 was coded as 0, 15-22 as 1 and ≥ 23 as 2. For binary logistic regression analysis, independent variable groups were coded as dummy variables: 0 and 1. Categorisation of overall knowledge scores were as follows: The maximum overall knowledge score was 37: poor knowledge (< 15), fair knowledge (15-22), and good knowledge (23-37) (Awad and Al-Nafisi, 2014; Khalil and Abdalrahim, 2014; Shaikh et al. 2011). The scores were summed up and converted to percentage as follows: poor knowledge (< 40 %), fair knowledge (40 – 59 %), and good knowledge (60-100 %) similar to Dada et al., (2016). 
Calculation of mean blood pressure Mean blood pressure for SBP and DBP were calculated by adding the two readings for each of them and divided by two. Based on mean SBP and DBP, participants were grouped as having normal BP (<120/<80 mmHg), elevated (120-129/<80 mmHg), stage 1 (130-139/80-89 mmHg) and stage 2 (≥140/≥90 mmHg) blood pressure. Finally, participants were re-grouped as hypertensive and not-hypertensive. Participants with NBP and elevated BP were categorised as not-hypertensive while stage 1 and stage 2 blood pressure groups were classified as hypertensive. Mean SBP and DBP were calculated. Bivariate analysis Bivariate analysis was carried out to compare the relationship between mean blood pressure groups and some socio-demographic variables of teaching and non-teaching staff using chi-square test and t-tests. Chi–square was used to assess the associations between independent variables (socio-demographic, knowledge scores) and dependent variable (high blood pressure) among teaching and non-teaching staff. The assumption was that for 2 x 2 tables, all expected counts were at least 10. If this assumption was violated, Fisher’s test value was used.

Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors (among socio-demographic variables and knowledge scores) associated with high blood pressure among teaching and non-teaching staff of University of Lagos. The dependent variable was the prevalence of HBP measured on a dichotomous scale (not-hypertensive and hypertensive) using enter method. All the variables that were statistically significant on the bivariate analysis were included in the regression model using a block entry approach. Variables that were statistically significant in the bivariate analysis include age, sex, level of education, family history, knowledge of risk factors of HBP, overall knowledge of HBP. All the input variables were checked for multicollinearity using variance inflation factor (VIF) before entering them in the multivariate analysis. Multicollinearity was seen between knowledge of HBP risk factors and the overall knowledge of HBP for non-teaching staff (VIF: 1.947 vs. 1.995); age and level of education (VIF: 1.284 vs. 1.225). When overall knowledge and level of education were deleted, all the other variables had a variance inflation factor (VIF) of 1. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated. P-values <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Ethical considerations Approval of this study was obtained from Health, Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) of Lagos University Teaching Hospital. The health research committee assigned number was: ADM/DCST/HREC/APP/1715. Informed consent was obtained from the participants before they were admitted into the study. Participants were told that they were free to leave the study at any time. Results Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents A total of nine hundred and seventy-eight (978) questionnaires made up of 489 questionnaires for teaching staff and another 489 questionnaires for non-teaching staff were administered among teaching and non-teaching staff of University of Lagos. Number of questionnaires available for analysis and discussion were 952 (476 for teaching staff and 476 for non-teaching staff). The response was very high, 97.3 % among teaching staff and 100.0 % among non-teaching staff. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. The mean age for teaching staff was statistically significantly higher than that of the non-teaching staff (48.9±8.56 % vs. 41.8±9.40 years: p<0.001).

Knowledge of high blood pressure among teaching than non-teaching staff Table 2 indicates that higher number of teaching staff knew that high blood pressure means “persistent increase in blood pressure” more than the non-teaching staff (59.7 % vs. 40.3 %: p<0.001) and this relationship was statistically significant. Also higher number of teaching staff knew how to diagnose or measure blood pressure than the non-teaching staff (54.5 % vs. 38.3 %: p<.001) and that difference was statistically significant. Lower percent of non-teaching staff than teaching staff knew the correct ways to prevent high blood pressure (34.0 % vs. 56.3 %: p<0.001). There was a low knowledge that high blood pressure is asymptomatic (15.3 % vs. 14.3 %: p=0.037) among the two groups of respondents. Below fifty percent knew that it is recommended that one checks his/her blood pressure always (21.4 % vs. 25.4 %: p=0.011).

The mean general knowledge score on HBP for teaching and non-teaching staff was 4.32±2.11 vs. 3.49±1.95. The result shows that below fifty percent of teaching staff had good grade for general knowledge on HBP compared to below thirty percent of non-teaching staff out of 10 questions (42.9 % vs. 23.7 %: p=0.001). The table also reveals the mean score of knowledge of HBP risk

factors for teaching and non-teaching staff as 12.41±3.87 vs. 11.23±4.40. The percentage of teaching and non-teaching staff that had good grade on knowledge of HBP risk factors out of 19 questions was fair (59.5 % vs. 49.8 %: p=0.003). Three quarter of the respondents, both teaching and non-teaching staff had good grade on knowledge of HBP complications (75.6 % vs. 73.3 %:p=0.05) with a mean knowledge score of 5.68±1.68 vs. 5.48±2.00 out of 8 questions. In overall knowledge, teaching staff had good grade compared to non-teaching staff (54.2 % vs. 44.1 %: p=0.001) with mean values of 23.24±6.08 and 21.01±6.73 respectively out of a total of 37 questions. There were also statistically significant differences in all the areas of the knowledge of HBP among teaching and non-teaching staff: general knowledge of HBP (χ2=39.588, p<0.001); knowledge of HBP risk factors (χ2=17.13, p<0.001); knowledge of complications of HBP (χ2=14.01, p<0.001) and overall knowledge (χ2=20.22, p<0.001).

Prevalence of high blood pressure among teaching than non-teaching staff Table 4 shows the mean prevalence of high blood pressure using the 2003 7th report of JNC classification among teaching than non-teaching staff as 127.05±13.44 vs. 123.64±16.15. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure of respondents were 79.62±7.68 vs. 78.56±9.57. The prevalence of HBP was higher among the teaching than non-teaching staff even though it was not statistically significant (24.2 vs. 22.9: p=0.702). However, the stage 2 HBP was higher among the non-teaching than the teaching staff (4.2 vs. 2.9: p<0.001).

Non-hypertensive teaching and non-teaching staff had poor knowledge of high blood pressure than those that are hypertensive and this should be checked to prevent more non-hypertensives drifting into hypertension.

Discussion High blood pressure has been described as a silent killer and a global public health crisis with no obvious or visible signs and symptoms (WHO, 2013; Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016 and American Heart Association (AHA), 2016). Good knowledge of high blood pressure has been reported to be positively associated with increased control of high blood pressure (Maginga et al. 2016). Our study found that a very low percentage of teaching and non-teaching ((15.3 % vs. 14.3 %) staff knew that high blood pressure is asymptomatic. The poor knowledge of this important information buttresses the need for health education and awareness creation in this study population. The high knowledge that high blood pressure can be prevented ((57.4 % vs. 68.0 %) among both teaching and non-teaching staff was similar to the result reported among members of teaching staff of higher institutions in Tanzania where approximately 66.0 % of the staff agreed that high blood pressure can be prevented (Mbuya et al., 2014). The number of teaching and non-teaching staff (23.1 % vs. 33.0 %) who did not know that hypertension cannot be cured was similar to the number cited among non-teaching staff of Niger Delta University, Balyesa State, Nigeria (30.0 %) (Adika, et al., 2011). A lower number of teaching and non-teaching staff who knew how to diagnose blood pressure (BP) (54.5 % vs. 38.8 %), correct name of BP measurement instrument (34.5 % vs. 14.6 %) and correct reading for normal BP (42.4 % vs. 30.7 %) unlike that reported among the non-teaching staff of Niger Delta University who had a higher knowledge of blood pressure measuring (80.0%) and monitoring (75.0 %) (Adika, et al., 2011). 
The knowledge level of risk factors of high blood pressure was higher than the values reported in one foreign and two Nigerian Universities. A study on knowledge of diabetes and hypertension among members of teaching staff of higher learning Institutions in Dar es, Tanzania reported that 43.2 % and 36.7 % of the staff identified hereditary and increasing age as causes of hypertension respectively. A cross-sectional study carried out on knowledge of hypertension among the staff of University of Ibadan reported that 28.0 % and 32.0 % agreed that hereditary and increasing age were risk factors of hypertension respectively (Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011; Mbuya et al. 2014). Also, among non-academic employees of Niger Delta University 59.0 % reportedly thought hereditary is a cause of HBP. The fact that almost all the respondents in this study group knew that stress (96.2 % vs. 92.4 %) and thinking/worries (97.1 % vs. 93.7 %) cause HBP as opposed to 37.0 % of respondents from University of Ibadan and 73.0 % from Niger Delta University (Adika et al., 2011; Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011). might be an indication that the employees of University of Lagos might be exposed to better HBP awareness than employees of these universities. Higher number of teaching than non-teaching staff knew that regular smoking (68.1 % vs. 63.3 %) and alcohol use (67.0 % vs. 64.1 %) were risk factors for HBP. This result

A comparative assessment of knowledge and prevalence of high blood pressure among teaching and non-teaching staff of University of Lagos, Nigeria 
indicates that the respondents especially the non-teaching staff had a better knowledge of risk factors of HBP than their colleagues from Niger Delta University, Bayelsa where a lower number of non-academic staff agreed that smoking (45.0 %) and alcohol use (43.0 %) were risk factors of HBP ((Adika et al., 2011). The knowledge was also lower among the staff of University of Ibadan where about 35.0 % strongly agreed that smoking (35.0 %) and alcohol (34.0 %) were risk factors for HBP (Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011) and also lower among teaching staff of higher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where 54.7 % and 38.1 % agreed that alcoholism and smoking were causes of HBP respectively (Mbuya et al., 2014). Our knowledge values for family history of high blood pressure as a risk factor of HBP among teaching and non-teaching staff (81.5 % vs. 70.2 %) were also higher than values reported among 41.7 % of teaching population in higher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The knowledge of obesity as a risk factor for HBP among teaching and non-teaching staff (70.8 % vs. 68.0 %) were higher when compared with the 60.4 % reported among the teaching population in Tanzanian higher learning institutions. Headache was correctly identified by teaching and non-teaching as one of the risk factors of high blood pressure (71.4 % vs. 73.9 %). A lower percentage (68.3 %) was reported among the teaching staff of higher institutions in Tanzania (Mbuya et al., 2014). Knowledge of use of certain drugs such as birth control pills as risk factor of HBP was higher among the study respondents (43.9 % vs. 38.0 %) than among the 17.3 % teaching staff of higher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Also, knowledge of regular salt diet as a risk factor for high blood pressure among the teaching and non-teaching staff (84.0 % vs. 73.3 %) was higher than the 50.4 % reported among the teaching population in higher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam but similar to that of non-academic staff employees of Niger Delta University (72.0 %) (Mbuya et al., 2014; Adika et al., 2011). Our knowledge percentages for regular high fat diet as a risk factor of HBP among teaching and non-teaching staff (64.7 % vs. 60.1 %) was lower than values reported among 80.0 % of non-academic staff of Niger Delta University (Adika et al., 2011). On knowledge of complications or health risks of high blood pressure, high number of participants even though greater among teaching than non-teaching staff identified stroke (90.3 % vs. 87.8 %) as a complication of high blood pressure. This result was higher than that reported among the employees of University of Ibadan (84.0 %) and teaching staff of higher learning institutions in Tanzania (71.2 %) (Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011). The number of teaching and non-teaching staff who identified heart failure/heart attack (92.0 % vs. 88.0 %) as complications of high blood pressure was higher than the 80.0 % from staff of University of Ibadan and 71.2 % from the teaching staff of higher learning institutions in Tanzania (Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011; Mbuya et al., 2014). Equal number of the teaching and non-teaching staff (47.7 % vs. 48.3 %) did not recognize

kidney failure as one of the complications of high blood pressure. This result was higher than 30.2 % reported among members of teaching staff of higher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and 40.0 % among the employees of University of Ibadan (Mbuya et al., 2014; Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011). The knowledge of blindness as a complication of HBP among the teaching and non-teaching staff (35.3 % vs. 36.1 %) was lower than the 65.5 % reported among teachers of higher learning institutions in Tanzania (Mbuya et al., 2014). Both teaching and non-teaching staff has equal knowledge of complications of high blood pressure. This knowledge might be because the incidence of stroke, premature death and heart attack are very common in Nigeria. However, generally, the mean knowledge level among the teaching and non-teaching staff that had good grade on general knowledge of HBP (42.9 % vs. 23.7 %); knowl- edge of HBP risk factors (59.5 % vs. 49.8 %), knowledge of HBP complications (75.6 % vs. 73.3 %) and overall knowledge (54.2 % vs. 44.1 %) shows that the respondents had a good knowledge of complications of HBP but low general knowledge of HBP, its risk factors and overall knowledge. A similar low knowledge conclusion was cited among the staff of university of Ibadan; non-academic employees of Niger Delta University, Bayelsa State and teaching staff of higher institutions in Dar er Salam, Tanzania (Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011; Adika et al., 2011; Mbuya et al., 2014).The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) (127.3±13.47 vs. 123.9±16.14: p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (79.8±7.68 vs. 78.8±9.56) mmHg for teaching staff were higher than that of the non-teaching staff. While our mean SBP was lower than that obtained among the teaching and non-teaching staff of Obafemi Awolowo Univer- sity (OAU), Ile-Ife (130.9 vs. 126.97) mmHg, our mean DBP was higher (77.1 vs. 75.7 mmHg) than theirs (Adedoyin et al., 2016). Our result was also lower than the mean SBP and DBP of Julius Centre University of Malaya in Malaysia (a Public University) 128.6 vs. 80.1 mmHg (Eng et al., 2016). Our finding was also lower than that mean diastolic hypertension reported among employees of Ambrose Ali University staff in Ekpoma, for the male senior and junior staff (158.3 vs. 144.3) mmHg and that of the teaching and non-teaching staff of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria: mean SBP (130.9 vs. 126.9) mmHg but higher than the DBP (77.1 vs. 75.7 mmHg) respectively (Omorogiuwa et al., 2009; Adedoyin et al., 2016). However, the result was higher than the mean SBP and DBP reported among the University of Ghana employees (116.8 vs.76.0 mmHg) (Aryeetey and Ansong, 2011) and that of the faculty members of College of Health Sciences, South Saudi Arabia (116.8 vs.76.0 mmHg) (Nazzal and Mousa, 2016).High systolic pressure has been reported to be a greater risk factor than diastolic pressure for brain, heart, kidney, and circulatory complications and for death, especially in middle-aged and elderly adults while high diastolic pressure is a strong indicator of heart attack and

stroke in young adults. The wider the gap between the systolic and diastolic measurements, the greater the consequences (Simon, 2014). The two high blood pressure numbers are important, but for people who are 50 years and above, systolic pressure give the most accurate diagnosis of high blood pressure (AHA, 2016b). The result shows that the prevalence of HBP was higher among the teaching than the non-teaching staff (24.2 % vs. 22.9 %). This finding is similar to the 21.3 % reported among Lecturers of University of Port Harcourt Medical School and 21.0 % among the staff of University of Ibadan, Nigeria;22.0 % among employees and families of Riyadh Saudi University; 18.2 % among a cohort of Julius Centre University of Malaya in Malaysia (a Public University); 22.0 % among Quassim University Personnel in Saudi Arabia and 20.0 % among the non-teaching staff of Khaja Bandanawaz Institute of Medical Sciences (KBNIMS), Kalaburgi, India. (Ordinioha, 2013; Abdullahi and Amzat, 2011; Alzeidan et al., 2016; Eng et al., 2016; Barrimah et al., 2009 and Mohin et al., 2016). The respondents were found to have higher blood pressure levels than that obtained among the teaching and non-teaching staff of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria (20.1 % vs.14.8 %) (Adedoyin et al., 2016). Our finding is lower than and the result among the senior and junior staff of Ambrose Ali University Ekpoma (38.9 % vs. 23.8 %) and the systolic BP among the senior and junior staff of Federal University of Technology, Owerri (34.0 % vs. 25.5 %) (Emereole et al., 2007; Omorogiuwa et al., 2009). The study population was also found to have lower prevalence of HBP compared to the 34.0 % reported among the faculty and administrative staff of King Faisal Saudi University with a high blood pressure of (32.9 % vs. 50.0 %, p<0.001) (Amin et al., 2014). However, this finding that high blood pressure was higher among the teaching staff than the non-teaching staff (24.2 % vs. 22.9 %) disagrees with that of the faculty and administrative staff of King Faisal Saudi University (32.9 % vs. 50.0 %) and the senior and junior staff of University of Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria (32.9 % vs. 40.4 %) where the prevalence of HBP was higher among the non-teaching (administrative and junior staff) than the teaching staff. It has been suggested that differences in job prescription and responsibilities might contribute to the variation in disease exposure and high blood pressure ((Amin et al., 2014; Adedoyin et al., 2016; Vincent-Onabanjo et al., 2016). 
Comparing the prevalence of HBP among the study population based on the 2017 ACC/AHA high blood pressure guideline with JNC7 instead of the 7th Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of HBP (JNC 7), it was found that there was an increased prevalence of HBP among the teaching and non-teaching respondents. There was a doubling effect on the proportion of respondents who were hypertensive from 24.2 % vs. 22.9 % to 64.7 % vs. 51.1 %. Similar doubling effect was observed among the US hypertensives from 32.0 % to 46.0 %. However, while the US increment is 14.0 % (Loannidis, 2017) our own is

approximately 41.0 %. Studies have shown that HBP is currently more prevalent in developing than in developed countries (40 % vs. 35 %) (Loannidis, 2017; WHO, 2010). This prevalence is highest in Africa than in United States (46 % vs. 35.0 %) (WHO, 2013) Based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, our result confirms the prediction that the global burden of hypertension will increase by 60 percent resulting in about 1.56 billion (1.54-1.58 billion) adults becoming hypertensive in 2025 (WHO, 2013). 
Conclusion Poor general knowledge level of HBP, risk factors and complications were higher among non-teaching than teaching staff while HBP prevalence was higher among teaching than non-teaching staff. Creation of health education and awareness on diet modification, improved physical activity and obesity reduction is important among teaching staff while improved knowledge level of HBP risk factors and complications, stress and obesity reduction are crucial among the non-teaching staff. 
Study Limitation The study limitation was mainly high cost of the study but we still completed it.

Abstract: A human pathogen called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the focus so much attention in worldwide. Now a days Covid-19 is a major public health problem throughout continental, subtropical and tropical regions. It is a viral infectious disease which is characterized by fever, cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, etc. In more severe or complicated Covid-19, patients with a severe febrile illness characterized by difficulty in walking, and coughing up blood. Six species of human coronaviruses are known (up to 2020), with one species subdivided into progress towards producing safe,effective coronavirus vaccines, a goal for near a year. At present, scientists and physicians have tried to treatthe Covid-19 patients with market available drugs, which are known as drug repurposing for Covid-19 treatment. Among them, some drugs show little or moderate effective results against Covid-19 and some do not. Although many drugs trails are under different types of phases. None could achieve full effectiveness against Covid-19 so far. During Covid-19 pandemic situation, health economic research specific to Covid-19 is urgently needed for controlling and preventing this disease.Continued dedication to surveillance efforts,particularly syndrome surveillance, advanced research and development for effective vaccines could fill existing gaps that currently limit the ability to control the spread of this disease.

Introduction Covid-19 is an easily transmittable viral infectious disease caused by a newly discovered strain of coronavirus which causes respiratory infections in humans. In 2020, it is a leading cause of serious illness and death in worldwide. There is no specific treatment for Covid-19. But early detection and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates below. An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to 26,182,808 confirmed cases in September, 2020.1Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded and positive (þ) sense RNA virus. It belongs to the beta-CoV genera of Coronaviridae family. Structural proteins like membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), spike protein (S) and envelope (E) protein play a vital role in the entry of virus and its replication in the host cell.1

Figure: left: Schematic diagram of the SARS coronavirus; right: Microscopic picture of coronavirus Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease in 2019 (Covid-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic.2, 3Colloquially known as simply the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19).The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public HealthEmergency of International Concern on 30th January 2020, and a pandemic on 11th March 2020.2As of 18:28 UTC on 2 September 2020, a total of 25,835,301 cases are confirmed in more than 227 countries and territories, and 26 cruise and naval ships. There are 7,854,448 active cases and 858,661 deaths.

The Covid-19 pandemic in Bangladesh is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by (SARS-CoV-2). The virus had spread to Bangladesh in March 2020. The first three known cases were reported on 8 March 2020 by the country's epidemiology institute, IEDCR. Since then, the pandemic has spread day by day over the whole nation and the number of affected people has been increasing.The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.4 Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible. As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 percent. Symptoms of Covid-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68 percent). Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing. Further it leads to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, kidney failure, etc. Covid-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest. The standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.5A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK. 
29 
Figure: Viral testing Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.6Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Drug repurposing (also called drug repositioning, profiling or re-tasking) is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication. This strategy offers various advantages over developing an entirely new drug for a given indication. 7There are many available drugs which are used as Drug Repurposing for Covid-19 treatment. Some of them are Antibody (Marvilimumab, Srilumab etc.), Antiviral (Remdesivir, Faipiravir, Ribavirin etc.), Antiparasitics (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin etc.), Antibiotics (Teicoplanin, Azithromycin etc.), Immunological (Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone, Interferon alpha-2b etc.). Covid-19 patients with shortness of breath, low oxygen levels below 93% and severe illness with pneumonia are allowed for plasma therapy.8 FDA approves use of convalescent plasma to treat critically ill patients.9Convalescent plasma therapy carries the risk of allergic reaction, lung damage, difficulty Breathing, Transmission of Infection including HIV Hepatitis A and C.Oxford university

coronavirus vaccine began phase 3 clinical trial in 2020. Scientist assumed that it’s most liable vaccine than any other trail vaccine. Now Vaccination is using to prevent and control the Covid-19. Methodology and Materials A systematic review was done to examine the effects of various therapy on multiple Covid-19 patients for different indications. The following databases were searched in: WebMD, Elsevier, PubMed, Google Scholar and MEDLINE. Information about study objectives, participants and type of study were searched systematically with extensive keywords to optimize the sensitivity of data collection from 2010-2020. For this review we explored about 40 published papers about Covid-19, Sars-Mars Cov-2, Drug repurposing for Covid-19 treatment.The electronic resource and database were investigated during this systemic review for relevant population based prevalence research from 2010-2020: PubMed (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.gov), Google scholar (scholar .google.com), etc. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Studies were included if they met all of the criteria: test and treatment of Covid-19, available in English language, original data or a review, etc. The flow of information from identification to inclusion of studies is summarized in following ways: 
Findings Remdesivir for Covid-19 patients: Clinical trials:Trial No 1: Remdesivir for 5 or 10 Days in Patients with Severe Covid-19. 10It was conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air, and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir for either 5 days or 10 days. All patients received 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days. The primary end point was clinical status on day 14, assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale.Trial No 2: Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 Preliminary Report. 11It was conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.Trial No 3: Remdesivir in adults with severe Covid-19: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. 12We did a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days

or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. 
Mavrilimumab for Covid-19 treatments: Trial No 1: Mavrilimumab improves outcomes in severe Covid-19 Pneumonia and systemic hyper-inflammation.13Sin- gle-center, open-label, single active arm intervention; Adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia (as evaluated by CT scanning), hypoxia (PaO2:FiO2 ratio≤300 mmHg), and systemic hyper-inflammation (increased C-reactive protein [CRP] ≥ 100 mg/mL and/or ferritin ≥ 900 μg/L, increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) received a single intravenous dose of mavrilimumab added to standard of care; follow-up 28 days.Main outcomes measure was time to clinical improvement (reduction ≥ 2 catego- ries on the 7-point WHO clinical status scale, 1=discharge, 7=death); others included time to discharge from hospital; % of pts. achieving a clinical improvement; survival; mechanical-ventilation free survival; time to fever resolution; CRP; PaO2:FiO2 ratio. 
Trial No: 2: GM-CSF blockade with mavrilimumab in severe Covid-19 pneumonia andsystemic hyper inflammation: a single-center, prospective cohort study.14 This single-center prospective cohort study included patients aged 18 years or older who were admitted to San Rafaela Hospital (Milan, Italy) with severe Covid-19 pneumonia, hypoxia, and systemic hyper inflammation. Patients received a single intravenous dose (6 mg/kg) of mavrilimumab added to standard care given by the hospital at the time. The control group consisted of contemporaneous patients with similar baseline charac- teristics who received standard care at the same hospital. The main outcome was time to clinical improvement (defined as improvement of two or more points on the seven-point ordinal scale of clinical status). Other outcomes included proportion of patients achieving clinical improvement, survival, mechanical ventilation-free surviv- al, and time to fever resolution. Adverse events were monitored daily. Lopinavir-Ritonavir with or without Interferon beta 1b for Covid-19 treatment: Trial No: 1: A Trial of Lopinavir–Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19.15It was conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category

ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. 
Trial No: 2 Triple combination of Interferon beta- 1b, Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Ribavirin.16This was a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial in adults with Covid-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688. Hydroxychloroquine without or with Azithromycin: Trial No: 1: Effect of Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) Treatment.17 Trial no: 2: A Rapid Systematic Review of Clinical Trials Utilizing Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as a Treatment for Covid‐19.18In this study, the literature currently available on CQ and HCQ as treatment of Covid‐19 was surveyed using EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and one clinical trial registry. Upon gathering published and preprint trials, risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0.Trial No: 3: Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of Covid-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial 19French Confirmed Covid-19 patients were included in a single arm daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. Combination of Ivermectin and doxycycline:Clinical trial:Trial No: 1 A Combination of Ivermectin and Doxycycline Possibly Blocks the Viral Entry and Modulate the Innate Immune Response in Covid-19 Patients.Chemical structures information for Ivermectin and doxycycline were downloaded from PubChem. In order to study the mode of interaction of Ivermectin and doxycycline with various SARS-CoV-2 proteins and receptors found on host cells, following PDB ID’s 6lu7 (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), 6m0j (SARS-CoV-2 spike), 6m71 (SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, NSP12), 6w02 (NSP3), 6w9c (PLpro), 6m3m (Nucleocapsid), 6w4b (NSP9), 6wkq (NSP10), 6vww (NSP15), 6wkq (NSP16) and 6m0j (ACE2) were used. All the protein structures were retrieved from protein data bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) and cleaned using USCF Chimera software (Petersen et al. 2004).Trial No:2 : A Case Series of 100 Covid-19 Positive Patients Treated with Combination of Ivermectin and Doxycycline.20 100 Covid-19 patients were enrolled in this study with a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

of the SERS-CoV-2 will be done at designated government hospitals. The clinical features and response to treatment were noted according to a dedicated protocol: Dexamethasone for covid-19 patients:Clinical Trial:Trial No: 1: Dexamethasone in hospitalized patients with covid-19 preliminary report.21Trial No: 2: Dexamethasone for Covid-19: data needed from randomized clinical trials in Africa.22Trial No: 03 After 62 years of regulating immunity, dexamethasone meets Covid-19 Tocilizumab: Clinical Trial:Trial No 1: Tocilizumab in patients severe Covid-19: a retrospective cohort study.23Trial No 2: Effective treatment of severe Covid-19 patients with tocilizumab.24Trial No 3: Tocilizumab for the treatment of severe Covid-19 pneumonia with hyperinflammatory syndrome and acute respiratory failure: A single center study of 100 patients in Brescia, Italy.25 Results and Discussion Remdesivir is a prodrug of an adenosine analogue with demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad range of RNA virus families.A total of 1063 patients underwent randomization. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unbinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group. Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Covid-patient, those were taking Remdesivir therapy are 15% fastly get well than non-taking covid patients.It’s approved by WHO for Covid-19 treatment.The most common adverse events were nausea (9% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7%), and constipation (7%). 
Mavrilimumab: Mavrilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor.It has been studied to see if it can improve the prognosis for patients with Covid-19 pneumonia and systemic hyper inflammation.The administration of mavrilimumab in patients admitted to hospitals with covid-19 pneumonia and hyper inflammation improved clinical outcomes com- pared with local standard care only.Adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia, hypoxia and systemic hyper inflammation received a single intravenous dose of marvilimumab added standard care, follow up 28 days. Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Ribavirin without or with interferon beta-1b:Interferon beta-1a is a cytokine in the interferon,(lopinavir-ritonavir) is protease inhibitor and ribavirin is an oral nucleoside analogue.The use of lopinavir/ ritonavir or other HIV protease inhibitors, owing to unfavorable pharmacodynamics and because clinical trials have no benefit in patients with Covid-19. Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay patients with mild to moderate Covid-19. Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a back- bone is warranted.

A comprehensive Review of Drug Repurposing for Covid-19 
Combination of Hydroxychloroquine & Azithromycin:Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial drug and azithromycin is an antibiotic. Hydroxychloroquine inhibit the IL-6, IL-17, INF-alpha, INF-gamma, and TNF-alpha.Azithromycin is thought to have good potential in preventing severe respiratory tract infections. According to study azithromycin was shown to significantly reinforce the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of 20 patients with severe Covid-19. Hydroxychloroquine noted it is contraindications for people with heart disease or diabetes. On 17thJune, 2020, WHO announced that the Hydroxychloroquine arm of the Solidarity Trial to find an effective Covid-19 treatment was being stopped. Combination of Ivermectin & Doxycycline: Ivermectin is a medication used to treat many types of parasite infection and doxycycline is a broad spectrum tetracycline antibiotic.This observational study, consisting of 64 males and 36 females was conducted from April to May 2020 in Bangladesh Medical College.Combination of Ivermectin and doxycycline was found to be very effective in viral clearance in mild and moderately sick Covid-19 patients.Tested negative and their symptoms improved within 72 hours. There were no noticeable side effects. 
Dexamethasone:Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used in a wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.Experimental applications have shown a one-third reduction in mortality in patients forced to breathe through a ventilator.These drug are suitable for those who hospitalized and receiving artificial oxygen.For those who only need oxygen supply, it has been reduced by one-fifth. 
Tocilizumab:This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults (≥18 years) with severe Covid-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tertiary care centers in Bologna and Reggio Emilia, Italy, between Feb 21 and March 24, 2020, and a tertiary care Centre in Modena, Italy, between Feb 21 and April 30. The proportion of patients on invasive ventilation from (84%) at t tocilizumab initiation to 60% on day and 28% day 14.Tocilizumab in severe Covid-19 resulted in a rapid decline in inflammatory markers.This was associated with reduced ventilation support requirements. 
Conclusion From the above discussion it’s clear that, there are no drug is fully safe or clinically effective for Covid-19 patients. Repurposing drugs for Covid-19 patients is dependent on various factors. Some Drugs has effective effect against Sars-Cov 2 virus .But we must obey proper protocol and proper guidelines for using those drugs.As, there no specific drug for covid-19 we must obey some rules and regulation.We must wear musk when going outside from home, keep maintain social distance, try maintain hygienic life style, without permission of Doctor we must not take any drug, etc. 
Scientists around the world are working faster than ever to develop and produce vaccines that can stop the spread of Covid-19. Now a days, Astrazeneca, Moderna, Pfizer etc. vaccines are using for protection and control this disease.
